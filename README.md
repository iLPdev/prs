<!-- SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
<p align="center">
    Mudlet script for Procedural Realms MUD
    <br />
</p>

<!-- LONG DESCRIPTION --> 
The Procedural Realms Script [PRS] project gives [Procedural Realms MUD](http://textdimension.com/) players improved access to the advanced features of the [Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org) MUD client. By leveraging the specific "out of band" packets sent by Procedural Realms' server, PRS correcly identifies rooms, stops creation of duplicate rooms, and accurately tracks your character's location on the map as you move about the realm. Additional convenience features include autosetting terrain colors, self-updating gauges for vitals, chat containers, and adjustable UI layout.

### History

#### Milestones

- v0.12.0 - Mini-map Congruence Achieved
- v0.5.0 - Begin package installation development
- v0.1.2 - Fixed exitstub tracking
- v0.2.1 - Fixed speedwalk

<!-- ### Vision

As complement to a planned Mudlet UI for Discworld MUD, the aim of this project is to provide existing and potential players with a newbie-friendly (accessible) and reliable means to map and navigate the Discworld MUD in an elegeant, modern MUD client. In line with that aim, the goal of this project is to release a Mudlet package with all the requisite aliases, triggers, and scripts. Ultimately, my hope is that discMapper might become a part of a larger Mudlet package for Discworld MUD, including guild-specific UI feature setss. -->

### Features

- Automatic GMCP mapping of Procedural Realms MUD
- Automatic GMCP room styling based on terrain.
  - Matches colors in PR's 'map' and 'look' quickmap.
- Tabbed Chat -- Adjustable, dockable, resizable, and no conversations lost in scroll!
- Self-updating gauges for charcater vitals, including Hit Points, Energy, Stamina, and eXperience Points.
- Speedwalking and pathfinding - Efficiently get where you're going - and fast!

### Built With

- [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is the programming language
- [Edbee Library](https://github.com/edbee/edbee-lib) provides the text editor component for Mudlet
- [Mudlet](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet) is a cross-platform, open source, and super fast MUD client
- [MDK](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK) is a collection of Lua 'classes' and modules by @demonnic
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) is the version-control system for tracking changes and project management
- [ImgBot](https://github.com/dabutvin/Imgbot) provides GitHub-integrated image optimization

[![Status Ventis][status-ventis]][andivionian-status-classifier] ![Travis (.com) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/iLPdev/discMapper/develop?style=flat)

- **Project State**: Procedural Realms Script is under active development. The application can be used, but may be unstable. We are in need of beta testing prior to moving forward with the v1.0.0 release.

- **Current Release**: v0.12.0

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Install

The [Mudlet Makers](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/graphs/contributors) could not have made it easier to install preconfigured custom aliases, triggers, scripts, keybindings, and UIs.

<!-- ### One-Click Install Method

Copy/paste the following command into Mudlet's input line to install discMapper:

```lua
lua function d(a,b)if not b:find("oci",1,true)then return end installPackage(b)os.remove(b)cecho("<lime_green>PRS package installed!\n")end registerAnonymousEventHandler("sysDownloadDone","d")downloadFile(getMudletHomeDir().."/oci.mpackage","https://github.com/iLPdev/prs/releases/download/v0.7.1/PRS.mpackage")
```
-->

### Package Install Method

Just like any other package as of Mudlet v4.8+, you may install PRS by simply dragging and droppping the package file into Mudlet. discMapper will then be merged into your active Mudlet profile, and you may delete the original file.

To install PRS, just follow these steps:

1. Locate the [latest release](https://github.com/iLPdev/prs/releases/latest) of PRS.
1. Download the .mpackage file listed under Assets.
1. Open Mudlet on your operating system of choice.
1. Open an existing Procedural Realms MUD profile or create a new one.
1. Locate the saved file on your PC.
1. Drag and drop the file into your open Procedural Realms MUD profile.
1. Optionally, delete the .mpackage file from your computer.

### Dependencies

- [MDK](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK) provides EMCO and SUG support.
- [Mudlet][mudlet-url] MUD Client application must obviously be installed on your operating system (Windows, MacOS, and Linux)

### Getting the Source

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The primary objective is to develop and test a minimally viable package for Mudlet that meets the requirements for includion on the list of connectable games when Mudlet starts and, in turn, to increase the playerbase of Procedural Realms.

Planned new features include:

See also the [open issues](https://github.com/iLPdev/prs/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
